I believe that I have the relevant technical skills (SQL, Python, R, Excel, and Tableau) and a growth mindset that makes me a great fit for the position. Currently, I am working as a business analyst for a startup known as Ourdate which is a dating application not yet launched in the market. My duties and responsibilities are to collect, organize, prepare, and analyze the usability test data. Share insights from the analyzes with the stakeholders, design, and engineering teams. From my experience, I have the skills to work in teams and self-learn concepts and analyses for problem-solving.  I am currently in F-1 OPT status. I received my EAD, already begun on 06/13/2022, which is an employment benefit that will enable me to work in the US for 12 months without employer sponsorship. I am eligible for the STEM OPT Extension, which is currently 24 months. So totally I can work for 3 years without employer sponsorship. After that time, I would need to be sponsored for another immigration status, such as H-1B.
