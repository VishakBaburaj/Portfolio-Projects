However, after researching it has become clear that Dairy Management Inc stands out as the best.  What Stood out to me the most is the experience that I can gain working in your company. As a fresher, the company that I am working for should provide me extensive workload so that I can gain the experience that I need to advance my technical skills and bring me closer to my final goal which is to advance through the hierarchy of analysts.   Having spent my last summer working as an intern in Tenhard India PVT LTD and working as a research assistant for HOS Business Analytics at Christ University I was able to achieve Project Management Skills. I was able to complete the data analysis and interpretation within a month for my research paper. Simultaneously, I was working as a summer intern in the field of marketing where I had to market the company's e-learning platform. I took an initiative to develop a python script to prioritize books that could be used to market their e-learning platform which led to a total sales conversion worth 10000 INR.   I am a recent graduate after completing my bachelor’s in marketing management and Human Resource I took up an initiative to develop my skills in analytics, therefore, leading to a dual degree program MBA in business analytics and MS in decision analytics. I was able to achieve my technical skills with the help of my mentor Head of School in Business Analytics. I am currently pursuing various online certifications to develop my analytical skills in various projects which I believe is necessary to keep my technical skills intact. The journey of an analyst is to learn more from your experience. The Internet is my best friend, and I am an active learner I am confident that I can learn new concepts and data modeling practices with my critical thinking approach based on a business problem.   I am looking forward to knowing more about the company and its work environment along with the duties and responsibilities your company expects from a Project Management intern. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss with you the contribution I can make to your company. Thank You for your time and consideration.

It was a dual degree program that helped me gain various technical skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, R, and SAS. Over these past 2 years, I have built up extensive experience working on real-life academic projects and my CV demonstrates this. What excites me the most about data analysis is the joy that I feel whenever I rectify an error and get appropriate results. I can access data analysis tasks from a strategic perspective. I can work to strict deadlines, and I also possess strong communication and interpersonal skills which helps me to work quickly and seamlessly in any team. | Major / Field of study:Marketing Management and Human Resource | Country:United States | School:Christ University, Bangalore | Dates of employment:2021-02-01 - 2021-03-01 | Last name:Baburaj | Major / Field of study:Decision Analytics | Degree:Master of Business Administration - MBA | ZIP / Postal Code:33955 | Dates of employment:2019-04-01 - 2019-05-01 | Company:Tenhard India Pvt Ltd. | Dates attended:2021-08-01 - 2022-05-01 | Email address:vishakbaburaj98@gmail.com | Cover letter:07/16/2022 Vishak Baburaj www.linkedin.com/in/vishakbaburaj Fort Myers, FL  Hiring Manager Corcentric Chicago, IL  Dear Hiring Manager,  I believe that it is hard to land an Analyst job when you are a fresher in the United States especially when you have an F1 OPT work authorization. However, after researching it has become clear that Corcentric stands out as the best. What Stood out to me the most is the experience that I can gain working in your company. As a fresher, the company that I am looking for should provide me extensive workload so that I can gain the experience that I need to advance my technical skills and bring me closer to my final goal which is to advance through the hierarchy of analysts.  Having spent my last summer working as an intern in Tenhard India PVT LTD and working as a research assistant for HOS Business Analytics at Christ University I was able to achieve Project Management Skills. I was able to complete the data analysis and interpretation within a month for my research paper. Simultaneously, I was working as a summer intern in the field of marketing where I had to market the company's e-learning platform. I took an initiative to develop a python script to prioritize books that could be used to market their e-learning platform which led to a total sales conversion worth 10000 INR.  I am a recent graduate after completing my bachelor’s in marketing management and Human Resource I took up an initiative to develop my skills in analytics, therefore, leading to a dual degree program MBA in business analytics and MS in decision analytics. I was able to achieve my technical skills with the help of my mentor Head of School in Business Analytics. I am currently pursuing various online certifications to develop my analytical skills in various projects which I believe is necessary to keep my technical skills intact. The journey of an analyst is to learn more from your experience. The Internet is my best friend, and I am an active learner I am confident that I can learn new concepts and data modeling practices with my critical thinking approach based on a business problem.  I am looking forward to knowing more about the company and its work environment along with the duties and responsibilities your company expects from an Analyst intern. I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss with you the contribution I can make to your company. Thank You for your time and consideration. I can easily be reached at your convenience by email at vishakbaburaj98@gmail.com and by Mobile (804)-274-8585.
