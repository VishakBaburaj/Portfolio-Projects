# Understanding the mental health of class XII students towards the delayed decision on board exams in India during second wave of COVID-19: :Sentiment Analysis & Word Frequency Analysis

## Problem statement

* The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on various industries including education.
* One major challenge faced is the shift in examination practices. It was announced that the class 12 board exams would be conducted offline during the second wave of COVID-19 in an effort to restore the traditional pattern.
* Thus, this project stands as a platform for the students to research student perspectives.

## Project approach

* Data collection
* Data understanding
* Data preparation
* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Results Discussion

## Data collection

* One common method for data collection is the survey method using Google Forms.
* Another method for data collection is the snowball sampling method, which involves starting with a group of primary contacts and asking them to distribute the survey to their acquaintances.

## Data understanding (Google Form)

* The first section includes three questions related to the students syllabus, their opinions, and emotions.
* The second section consists of asking students to explain why they want the board exams to be canceled.
* The third section consists of asking students to explain why they want their exams to be conducted later.
* The fourth section consists of asking students to indicate which country they are from.

## Data preparation and analysis

* Text preprocessing: This involves cleaning and organizing textual data to make it suitable for analysis.
* Two techniques were used to extract insights: Sentiment analysis and Word frequency analysis.
* Sentiment analysis involves analyzing the sentiment of a particular text. In this case, the Vader lexicon sentiment analysis method was used. This is a rule-based sentiment analysis framework that uses a library of words, emoticons, and slang words that are associated with specific scores.
* The next step was to identify the word frequency of different emotions. To do this, the frequency of each emotion was calculated. This can provide insights into the content and tone of the text, as well as identify trends and patterns.

## Data visualization and results discussion

Exploratory data analysis: Insights on Student Sentiments

* A sample of 38,239 students across India was studied. The results of the sentiment analysis showed that 18% of the sample had a negative, 44% had a positive, and 38% had a neutral sentiment.
* When it came to the question of whether the exams should be canceled or conducted later, 79% of the sample size wanted the exams to be canceled, while 21% wanted the exams to be conducted later.
* To further explore the data, the distribution of sentiments was visualized by the syllabus. The results showed that, out of the total sample size:
* Students following a state board syllabus had 8% negative, 26% positive, and 23% neutral sentiment.
* Students following a CBSE syllabus had 9% negative, 14% positive, and 17% neutral sentiment.
* To further understand the attitudes and perspectives of the students on the issue of class 12 board exams during the COVID-19 pandemic, parameters were built based on the syllabus and opinions, creating an interactive dashboard that allows for the identification of the distribution of sentiments.

Word Frequency Analysis: Insights on Student Emotions

* The word frequency analysis was important in understanding the emotions that students were feeling regarding the commencement of class 12 board exams offline during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* The top three emotions identified through the analysis were stress, confusion, and inability to concentrate. These emotions likely reflect the anxiety and uncertainty that many students are feeling about the exams and the challenges of preparing for them during the pandemic.
* The word frequency analysis can also be explored based on different parameters, such as sentiments and opinions, to provide deeper insights into the sentiments and experiences of specific opinions of students.

## Conclusion

* This research has provided valuable insights into the emotions and experiences of students preparing for class 12 board exams in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing data collected through surveys and using techniques like sentiment analysis and word frequency analysis, we were able to identify key themes and patterns in student responses.
* Overall, the findings of this research highlight the importance of supporting students as they navigate the challenges of preparing for exams during a pandemic. By understanding the emotions and concerns of students, educators and policymakers can work to create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment that helps students succeed.
